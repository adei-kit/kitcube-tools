ChangeLog - kitcube-tools 
A. Kopmann



TODO:
- daqdevice, add module number in the function getDataDir()
  Advantage: the whole convention can be skipped by using the ini-statement dataSubDir.
  Needed for reading ORCA files from arbitrary folders.
- Remove getFilenumber from wolkenkamera.cpp the new implementation of daqdevice should be 
  flexiible enough - test required
- Implement a own class for the Campbell data logger file format. It should read
  furhter information from the header and define the appropriate timestamp format.
  Also a data reader for the Campbell should be added.
- Decode the binary data format?!

Release notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.34:
 - Added latest changed to the repository at GITHUB 
 - Modufied the script push_backup.sh to work with a whitelist instead of the exclude configuration.
   (working name: push_backup_wl.sh)
 - Added sensorGroup support for new EBM masts and first set of sensor definitions
 - Added sensorGroup support for campbell loggers (flux, slow, rainwind)
 - Reading header of a data file, if configuration file is missing.
 - Added error handling if no data file are found
   25.7.14 (ak)
 
 - Enhanced the CSV-Reader in DAQAsciiDevice in order to read the Campbell DataLogger-format A05.
   The header of this format is not detectable by comment characters and a human readable timestamp
   is used. 
 - Added the function akInifile:readFullString() in order to read the complete line without
   splitting it in tags. This is necessary if timestamp formats used by strptime should be read from 
   the inifile.
   14.1.14 (ak)

Version 0.33:
 - Added campaign name to script configuration file.
   26.6.13 (ak)
 - Improved error handling of kitcube-status display. The function getadeidata and getadeiplot now
   deliver also in an error case the expected data format. 
   23.3.13 (ak)
 - Using the new inifile parameter datafileIndexFormat for parsing the cloud camera date.
   There should be no hardcoded dependancy in wolkenkamera.cpp
   1.3.13 (ak)
 - Added export of the data archive to remote computers. (export_archive.sh)
   The manual has also been updated.
   12.2.13 (ak)
 - Fixed detection of file types with some file systems (e.g. XFS)
 - Removed numbering of directories for non-kitcube projects
 - Updated the build system files. Automake shold work now agian on linux + mac!
   4.2.13 (ak)

 - Added new parameter for format of the index field to rank files (datafileIndexFormat)
   The format is based on strftime format.
   11.9.12 (ak)
 - Added push mode to rsync-scripts. Reporting required different handling of log files. 
 - Added detection of errors in the radio probe data format.
   BUT it is obvious that there are more things that can go wrong and are not detected.
   27.9.12 (ak)
 - Generalized cloud camera reader. Remove hardcoded "cc2" tag in the code.
   21.9.12 (ak)
 - Improved SISOMOP reader. It is now possible that the data file starts with any sensor line. 
   Before only the order 1,2,3 have been allowed. 
   Continued reading after illeagal characters - found on in the EB2 data file.
   18.9.12 (ak)

Version 0.32:

   10.7.12 (ak)
 - Improved sync-script semaphores. The PID of the sync-process is checked 
   in addition to the existance of the file itself.
   26.6.12 (ak)

   Afterwards alias names for certain sensors might follow.
   9.12.11 (ak)
 - Changed timing of the reader loop to start with the first loop directly after
   the application starts
   7.12.11 (ak)
 - Added the line "* /" to all rsync append files (etc/rsync) in order to enable 
   selection of file masks in a directory structure.

Version 0.21 (code returned to ak):
 - libtool does not produce any output. Droped libtool and automatically generated newly.
 - readHeader() is not used anymore --> implement readheader(filename) instead
   Fixed SimRandom, works again
 - SQL syntax in CREATE TABLE has changes: Use ENGINE instead of TYPE !!!
 - Added build instruction for copies of the reader application (used by start scripts) 
 - Introduced reader application id to distinguish between serveral
   reader processes. Every application has it's own SysLog table.
   The module numbers for the SysLog tables start from 100.
 - Started kitcube-monitoring application to control the reader applications remotely. 
   The first and only command (quit)  can be used to terminate the reader safely.
 - Added new database table to summarize the status of all DAQDevices.
   Extended Kitcube-monitoring to report on changing alarm status
   The DAQDevice implementation needed to be extended to automatically update the Statuslist table.
 - Debug message in the levels 0+1 reorganized. The first two level do not report on 
   every cycle of the reader loop. 
 - Added start-skripts for OpenSuSE. Soft-Terminate via TCP-Control.
 - Changes to the inifile handling: Increased the maximal length of a line from 256 to 1024 
   (reqired for the mast definition, NF has done this before but the changes where not added 
    to the main branch of akutil). Added TAB to the list of delimiters.
 - Special naming schemes for windtracer added.
 - Added monitoring page to ADEI. This need a copy of kitcube-monitor at the ADEI server and 
   some scripts (not completely satisfing now).
 - Implemented first version of an alarm skript. Sending of Mails to the alarm list need to be added. 
   (bin/chk_alarm.sh). Added to the crontab – without sending mails the alram log is written.
   16.11.11 ak
 - Added missing header, removed compiler warnings
   Added endian.h header to the project for OSX compatibility 
   21.10.11 ak


Version 0.3:
 - Re-structured debug output
 - Added performance parameters to the reader. Cycle time, free disk space and the
   transfered amount of data are logged. The database access is shifted to the base class.
 - Added module to read the KATRIN Lara experiment files. These module contains
   second data and header information in the file name. Both parts are stored in a
   separate database table.
 - Multi-module support for the reader 
   28.1.10 ak  

Version 0.2:
 - Added automatic reconnect of the database connection. 
   In case of a connection loss to the database no further data is processed.
   If the connection can be re-established the processing is continued.
 - Fixed bug in calculating the file index for the Ceilometer
   Initialisation of the time structure was missing.
 - Moved code to GIT repository
   24.11.09 ak
