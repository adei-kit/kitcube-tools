ChangeLog - kitcube-tools 
A. Kopmann


Version 0.24:
 - Implementation for Parsivel added. Evaluated benefit of compression 
   for complex (= blob) data in the database. 
 - Implementation for soil moisture probe (sisomop.cpp) added.
   The module is another device attached to the masts.
   21.3.12 (ak)
 - Added three modes to sync_files. 
   One mode handles flat directories with manys files. (e.g. CC, CM)
   8.3.12 (ak)


Version 0.23:
 - Added appId and init scripts for kitcube-data. 
   3.3.12 (ak) 
 - Detect name of the application to be started from the name of the start-script
   so that no modification in the file are required for a new application.
 - Improved detection of unavailable database
   14.2.12 (ak) 
 - Extension of alarm module for multiple applications.
   Alarm notification script for sync_files.sh added.
   1.2.12 (ak)
 - Added customizable reader for CSV data files to DAQAsciiDevice.
   There are a few inifile parameters to select comment character and data separator.
 - Added script to acquire monitoring information for the computer infrastructure
   30.1.12 (ak)
 - Extended status table by operator enable function. Added support in kitcube-monitor. 
 - Using hardlinks for the copies of the reader applications.
   Makefile.am updated
   20.1.12 (ak)

Version 0.22:
 - Added option to add alias names to the sensors list. With a second parameter
   the number of created entries in the database is limited to the first part.
   Afterwards alias names for certain sensors might follow.
   9.12.11 (ak)
 - Changed timing of the reader loop to start with the first loop directly after
   the application starts
   7.12.11 (ak)
 - Added the line "* /" to all rsync append files (etc/rsync) in order to enable 
   selection of file masks in a directory structure.
 - Added new class variable dataTablePrefix in DAQDevice to define the prefix of the 
   data tables (currently: Data_ or Profiles_). This removes the need to define 
   create_data_table_name() in all readers with compex data.
   23.11.11 (ak)
 - Added update of status table for every reader call in class Wolkenkamera. 
   Will display correct status table now, before was always hang in status "starting"
   18.11.11 (ak)
 - Added OrcaProcess module for KATRIN. It is intended to fiddle ORCA log files from the 
   process containers in ADEI.
 - Added a configuration switch to limit the timestamp to seconds only (useTicks).
   16.11.11 (ak) 


Version 0.21 (code returned to ak):
 - libtool does not produce any output. Droped libtool and automatically generated newly.
 - readHeader() is not used anymore --> implement readheader(filename) instead
   Fixed SimRandom, works again
 - SQL syntax in CREATE TABLE has changes: Use ENGINE instead of TYPE !!!
 - Added build instruction for copies of the reader application (used by start scripts) 
 - Introduced reader application id to distinguish between serveral
   reader processes. Every application has it's own SysLog table.
   The module numbers for the SysLog tables start from 100.
 - Started kitcube-monitoring application to control the reader applications remotely. 
   The first and only command (quit)  can be used to terminate the reader safely.
 - Added new database table to summarize the status of all DAQDevices.
   Extended Kitcube-monitoring to report on changing alarm status
   The DAQDevice implementation needed to be extended to automatically update the Statuslist table.
 - Debug message in the levels 0+1 reorganized. The first two level do not report on 
   every cycle of the reader loop. 
 - Added start-skripts for OpenSuSE. Soft-Terminate via TCP-Control.
 - Changes to the inifile handling: Increased the maximal length of a line from 256 to 1024 
   (reqired for the mast definition, NF has done this before but the changes where not added 
    to the main branch of akutil). Added TAB to the list of delimiters.
 - Special naming schemes for windtracer added.
 - Added monitoring page to ADEI. This need a copy of kitcube-monitor at the ADEI server and 
   some scripts (not completely satisfing now).
 - Implemented first version of an alarm skript. Sending of Mails to the alarm list need to be added. 
   (bin/chk_alarm.sh). Added to the crontab â€“ without sending mails the alram log is written.
   16.11.11 ak
 - Added missing header, removed compiler warnings
   Added endian.h header to the project for OSX compatibility 
   21.10.11 ak


Version 0.3:
 - Re-structured debug output
 - Added performance parameters to the reader. Cycle time, free disk space and the
   transfered amount of data are logged. The database access is shifted to the base class.
 - Added module to read the KATRIN Lara experiment files. These module contains
   second data and header information in the file name. Both parts are stored in a
   separate database table.
 - Multi-module support for the reader 
   28.1.10 ak  

Version 0.2:
 - Added automatic reconnect of the database connection. 
   In case of a connection loss to the database no further data is processed.
   If the connection can be re-established the processing is continued.
 - Fixed bug in calculating the file index for the Ceilometer
   Initialisation of the time structure was missing.
 - Moved code to GIT repository
   24.11.09 ak


Version 0.1:
 - Initial version:
   Framework to simulate and read data from the kitcube devices. 
   Implementated modules are: Mast, Ceilometer (wo binary data).
